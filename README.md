**Experimental Project**

Description
To conclude my two years of integrated preparatory studies, we had to carry out an experimental project. My topic was distributed intelligence.

Topic: Distributed Intelligence
For my part of the project, I chose to explain and illustrate the behavior of ants when they search for food. I used a Thymio robot to illustrate my points and create a visual experiment.

**Experiment Breakdown**

Part 1: Searching for Food
In this first part, the Thymio robot simulates an ant searching for food. The robot starts from its base and moves towards a black dot on a map, avoiding various obstacles placed in its path. The black dot represents the food.

Part 2: Returning to the Base with Pheromones
In the second part, the robot simulates the ant's return to the base. As it returns, the ant deposits a chemical substance (pheromones) to mark the path to the food. The Thymio robot, in line-following mode, follows a path marked with black tape to represent the pheromones.

**Instructions:**
Configuring and Coding the Robot
The Thymio robot was programmed in Aseba language (.aesl). Follow the steps below to configure your robot:

1. Install [Thymio Suite] (https://www.thymio.org/products/programming-with-thymio-suite/).
2. Open Aseba.
3. Connect your Thymio robot.
4. Insert the code provided in the GitHub repository.
5. Create your map with obstacles for the first code and add a path with black tape for the second code.
6. Let your creativity take over for the creation of the map and the development of the code.


This experimental project aims to demonstrate the intelligent behavior of ants through the use of a Thymio robot. 
By simulating food searching and returning to the base with pheromones, we can better understand distributed intelligence in nature.
